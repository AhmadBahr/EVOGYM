## General Info
EVOGYM is a responsive gym website built with React and TypeScript, offering users an interactive and dynamic UI. It features sections like services, membership plans, and contact forms. The project is optimized for performance and accessibility, utilizing modern web technologies and best practices.

## Technologies Used:

# React
React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. EVOGYM uses React's component-based architecture to create reusable, interactive UI elements.

# TypeScript
TypeScript is a statically typed superset of JavaScript that adds type annotations. It helps catch errors during development and improves the code quality for large-scale projects

# CSS3
CSS3 is used to style the webpage surrounding the game canvas, ensuring it is responsive and visually appealing. It also handles some of the gameâ€™s UI components.

# Tailwind CSS
Tailwind CSS is a utility-first CSS framework that allows for rapid design and styling of the application. It helps create a responsive and visually appealing user interface with minimal custom CSS.

# Tailwind Prettier Plugin
This plugin ensures consistent formatting by integrating Prettier with Tailwind CSS, enforcing best practices when writing utility classes.

# Tailwind Sorting
Tailwind Sorting enforces consistent class ordering within the code, improving readability and maintainability.

# Vite
Vite is a fast build tool and development server for modern web projects. It speeds up the development process by providing fast Hot Module Replacement (HMR) and efficient bundling, allowing developers to see changes instantly in the browser.

# Google Fonts
Google Fonts are used to improve the aesthetics of the site with well-chosen typography that enhances readability and brand feel.

# Heroicons
Heroicons is a set of free MIT-licensed high-quality SVG icons used for UI elements in the project.

# Framer Motion
Framer Motion is a library for creating smooth animations and transitions. It is used throughout EVOGYM for an enhanced user experience.

# FormSubmit
FormSubmit allows the website to handle form submissions via email without requiring a backend, enabling a smooth user experience for contact forms.

# React Anchor Link
React Anchor Link Smooth Scroll is used to handle smooth scrolling behavior between sections, providing a seamless navigation experience.
